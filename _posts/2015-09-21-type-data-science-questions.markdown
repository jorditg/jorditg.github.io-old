Data Scientist use its analysis tools for different purposes. 

The problems can be classified in different categories according to the result that we want ot achieve:

1. **Descriptive**: In this case the goal is the description of data. Usually it is not generalizable without further analysis. 
2. **Exploratory**: Here the goal is to discover new connections. Plots are very important in thistype of studies. Dimensionality reduction techniques are also applied for visualization of multidimentsional data. In any case, in this type of studies is important to remember that **correlation does not necessarily imply causation**.
3. **Inferential**: The goal in this types of studies is the estimation of variabes of a population using reduced samples of the same population. The challenge in this problems is to get good samples that are representative of the population. When this is not done in the right way, important biases in the inferenced variables can be produced.
4. **Predictive**: Here the data scientist uses data of some objects to predict the behaviour of another. Keep in mind that **NOT NECESSARILY** *X predicts Y* means that *X causes Y*.
5. **Causal**: Here the Data Scientist uses randomized studies to find causation between variables.
6. **Mechanistic**: When Physical and Engineering Sciences are involved.

Remember that **Prediction is not Inference**. Both are important. 

Prediction normally is more challenging that inference.
