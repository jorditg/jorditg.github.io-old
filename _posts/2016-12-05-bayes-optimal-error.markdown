A key factor for evaluation of machine performace against human performance is the standard used to measure the last one.
If we are talking for example about a medical classification task, we can use as a human standard the next different measures:

1. A person (not a doctor)
2. A general doctor
3. A specialized doctor
4. A highly experienced specialized doctor
5. A team of highly experienced specialized doctors

Which one of all this options defines what **human performance** is? It is important to define the standard we are comparing against.

In any case in most of the cases we can consider that the *team of highly experienced specialized doctors* can be approximated to the *Bayes Optimal Error*.
